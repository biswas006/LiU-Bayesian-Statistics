# LiU-Bayesian-Statistics

The course aims to give a solid introduction to the Bayesian approach to statistical inference, with a view towards applications in data mining and machine learning.

The course has 4 modules:

-- Bayesics: Basic concepts about likelihood, priors, (one|multi)-parameter models, marginalization.
-- Bayesian Regression and Classification
-- More advanced models, MCMC and Variational Bayes
-- Model Inference and Variable Selection

* Lab1: Exploring posterior distributions in one-parameter models by simulation and direct numerical evaluation
* Lab2: Polynomial regression and classification with logistic regression
* Lab3: MCMC using Gibbs sampling and Metropolis-Hastings
